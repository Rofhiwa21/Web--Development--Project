                <h1>Our Environmental Responsibility</h1>
                <img class="lightboxTrigger" src="_images/pages/products_and_services/Environment1.jpg" width="800" height="400">
                    <p>At TacticsInTechIT, we care about the environment and the impact of our IT activities on it. We are aware that electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing problem that poses serious threats to human health and natural resources. E-waste is any discarded electronic device or component that contains hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. E-waste can contaminate soil, water, and air, and cause various diseases and disorders. According to the [Global E-waste Monitor 2020], South Africa generated 2.2 million tonnes of e-waste in 2019, ranking 25th in the world. Only 12% of this e-waste was collected and recycled. The rest was dumped in landfills or burned in informal settings. This is unacceptable and unsustainable.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>We follow these principles:</h2>
                    <img class="lightboxTrigger" src="_images/pages/products_and_services/Environment2.jpg" width="800" height="400">
                        <ul>
                            <li>We reduce e-waste by repairing and reusing IT devices whenever possible.</li>
                            <li>We collect and recycle e-waste from our clients and partners using certified e-waste recyclers.</li>
                            <li>We educate our clients and partners on the importance and benefits of e-waste management.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <p>That is why we are committed to responsible e-waste disposal and recycling.</p>
